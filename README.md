XSPF_Playlist_Extractor
=======================

This Script extracts XSPF playlist files to a specified folder.

Just a hobby project I put together in my free time. I've tested this script on Ubuntu 13.10, but it should work with other *nix distros too.

## usage

    >>> python XSPF_Playlist_Extractor.py
